# Rolling ball

Rolling Ball is a simple game in which you move a ball through a labyrinth in order to make it fall into a hole and get access to the next level.

Try it [live](http://goo.gl/NUfKQi):

- keyboard control: use arrows to make the ball roll, and space to make it jump
- device motion control: change the orientation of your mobile device to make the ball roll, and move it up to make the ball jump

## Notes

The web app makes use of canvas to draw graphics and the Device Orientation API to move the ball.

This demo is part of [this MDN page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Apps/Build/gather_and_modify_data/Keep_it_level_responding_to_device_orientation_changes) that explains how to use the Device Orientation API in a Open Web App.
